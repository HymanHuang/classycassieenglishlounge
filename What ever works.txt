Hey, guys, it's great to talk to you again. 

The holiday is coming soon.Yesterday, I was talking with a friend about where to go on vacation, and we were talking about if we wanna to go by train or by plane.

But you know, the plane ticket is so expensive, so we set it down on trains. But the train tickets are sold out too.

And, we were like, oh my god, really, it didn't leave us too many options, what should we do? What ever works, I guess. 

So that's today's expression, what ever works. it means that
you don't have a better choice.and you can just, you have to go with what ever works, I know, it's not wisedom but it happens sometimes.

So next time when it happens, you know what to say:
ok, what ever works, oh my god.

Anyway, I hope you all will have a great holiday, and I will talk to you soon.
