Hey, guys, did you have a great day?
The weather here today is really good.
Not cold at all, very very sunny, lots of sunshine.
And my friend just told me really funny story about her cooking
she was trying to cook something and it was her first time cooking.
But she mistakely put too much salts which she thought was sugar.
So, the food turned out to be very fine looking 
it looks great but it tastes terrible.  
so basicly, she destroyed the food.
yeah, the devil is in  the details, that's today expression.
it means if you are not careful with the details, the small points,
you may fail you may destory something  like my friend
it was just a very small mistake but she just destroyed the food
So guys,remember the devil is in the details you got to be careful always,
always be careful. 
Ok, that's all for today, I hope you like it. 
And I will talk to you soon.
